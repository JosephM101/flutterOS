# flutterOS (WIP)

An OS based on Raspberry Pi OS for running Flutter apps, kiosk-style! Support for keyboard and mouse, as well as DSI touchscreens is available.

This project is based on the awesome `flutter-pi` project, and uses `pi-gen` to create the Raspberry Pi image.

This project is currently a WIP.
